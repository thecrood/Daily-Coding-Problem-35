    " * Maintain three sections of the array using two indices, low and high:\n",
    "      * Strictly 'R's: array[:low]\n",
    "      * Unknown: array[low:high]\n",
    "      * Strictly 'G's: array[high:]\n",
    "      \n",
    "Initially, low will be 0 and high will be len(array) - 1, since the whole array is unknown. As we iterate over the array, we'll swap any 'G's we see to the third section and decrement high. If we see an 'R', then we just need to increment low, since that's where it belongs. We can terminate once low crosses high. So we can gradually shrink our unknown section through the following algorithm:"
